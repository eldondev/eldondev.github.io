          I think a lot about testing when writing code, but recently I have hit what I see as a major stumbling block. The core issues here is that <u><i>I am not writing much code.</i></u> At least, that's the goal. When I do write code, it is usually a contribution to one of the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">well-established</a> <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">products</a> <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">I</a> <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm">use</a>. The biggest frustration for me there is the lack of true distributed test harnesses. My great hope for this was http://whirr.apache.org/, but it seems to be slow to catch on, or else it is not effectively used in tests. I deeply hope that this gets remedied. <br>E.S., 2012-01-12</p>
